# TechnicalStockAnaylsisWithShiny
Showing stock technical indicators in a Shiny app

This is a work in progress. It's a small app to help me learn Shiny, as well as technical stock analysis. It will be updated on a semi-regular basis.

Note that this is a single file app. I'll probably split into separate ui and server files in the near future

There is a working version of this app on Shinyapps.io at https://jaype.shinyapps.io/TechnicalStockAnaylsisWithShiny/

UPDATE: 10/29/2018

* Fixed issue with missing chart when no options were selected.
* Changed 20 day Simple Moving Average to 50 day.
* Added MACD option.
